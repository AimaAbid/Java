//In this code, I've surrounded the FileWriter object creation and usage with a try-catch block to handle the potential IOException. Additionally, I've added a close() call to properly close the FileWriter when you're done writing. It's important to close the resources you open to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper resource management.

//FileNotFoundException: Like with the previous code, the FileWriter constructor can throw a FileNotFoundException if the specified file does not exist. To handle this, you should use a try-catch block or declare that the method throws this exception.IOException: The FileWriter constructor can also throw an IOException if there are issues with opening or writing to the file. This is a broader exception that encompasses various I/O-related problems.
